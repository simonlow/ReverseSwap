# ReverseSwap

This is a simple program I coded in a timed environment (took about 30 minutes), in order to practice Python logic. 

It takes in a sentence, reverses the order of the words and then switches the case of each letter in the string.

E.g.: COding IS very FUN --> fun VERY is coDING
E.g.: PytHOn iS the BEst LangUAGE --> lANGuage beST Is pYThoN
